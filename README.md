# ECG Emotion Recognition Using DREAMER Dataset

This project implements a complete **MATLAB-based ECG Emotion Recognition System** using the DREAMER physiological dataset.  
The system extracts ECG signals, preprocesses them, detects R-peaks, computes HRV and amplitude-based features, performs FFT analysis, and classifies emotional states using percentile thresholds.  
All generated plots and the final project report are included in this repository.

## 🫀 ECG Processing Pipeline

### 1️⃣ Preprocessing
- DC offset removal  
- Amplitude normalization  
- Bandpass filtering (0.5–50 Hz)

### 2️⃣ R-Peak Detection
- Detected using height + minimum RR distance constraints  
- Used to compute RR intervals and amplitudes  

### 3️⃣ Feature Extraction
- Peak amplitude  
- RR intervals  
- Moving standard deviation (for dominance)  

### 4️⃣ Frequency-Domain Analysis
- FFT power spectrum shows dominant ECG frequencies  
- Useful for stress and arousal estimation  

### 5️⃣ Visualization
Generated charts include:
- Filtered ECG with R-peaks  
- RR interval trend  
- RR histogram  
- FFT power spectrum  
- Correlation matrix  
- Boxplots  
- Stacked emotional sub-feeling distribution

## 😊 Emotion Classification

Emotions are computed using **percentile thresholds**:

### **Valence**
- Happy  
- Sad  
- Neutral  

### **Arousal**
- Excited  
- Calm  
- Neutral  

### **Dominance**
- Confident  
- Passive  
- Neutral  

These categories are derived using:
- Peak amplitude  
- RR interval  
- Moving RR standard deviation
